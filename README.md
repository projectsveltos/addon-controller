# What is the Projectsveltos?
Projectsveltos is mainly a Kubernetes add-on controller that simplifies the deployment and management of add-ons in Kubernetes clusters. With Sveltos controller, you can easily automate the deployment process and ensure consistency across your cluster environment.

## Addon deployment: how it works

![sveltos logo](./doc/sveltos.png)

The idea is simple:
1. from the management cluster, selects one or more `clusters` with a Kubernetes [label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors);
2. lists which `addons` need to be deployed on such clusters.

where term:
1. `clusters` represents both [CAPI cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/api/v1beta1/cluster_types.go) or any other Kubernetes cluster registered with Sveltos;
2. `addons` represents either an [helm release](https://helm.sh), Kubernetes resource YAMLs or [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) resources.

Here is an example of how to require that any CAPI Cluster with label *env: prod* has following features deployed:
1. Kyverno helm chart (version v2.6.0)
2. kubernetes resource(s) contained in the referenced Secret: *default/storage-class*
3. kubernetes resource(s) contained in the referenced ConfigMap: *default/contour*.

```yaml
apiVersion: config.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProfile
metadata:
  name: deploy-kyverno
spec:
  clusterSelector: env=prod
  syncMode: Continuous
  helmCharts:
  - repositoryURL:    https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/
    repositoryName:   kyverno
    chartName:        kyverno/kyverno
    chartVersion:     v3.0.1
    releaseName:      kyverno-latest
    releaseNamespace: kyverno
    helmChartAction:  Install
    values: |
      admissionController:
        replicas: 3
  policyRefs:
  - name: storage-class
    namespace: default
    kind: Secret
  - name: contour-gateway
    namespace: default
    kind: ConfigMap
```

As soon as a cluster is a match for above ClusterProfile instance, all referenced features are automatically deployed in such cluster.

Here is an example using Kustomize:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProfile
metadata:
  name: flux-system
spec:
  clusterSelector: env=fv
  syncMode: Continuous
  kustomizationRefs:
  - namespace: flux-system
    name: flux-system
    kind: GitRepository
    path: ./helloWorld/
    targetNamespace: eng
```

where GitRepository synced with Flux contains following resources:

```bash
├── deployment.yaml
├── kustomization.yaml
└── service.yaml
└── configmap.yaml
```

Refer to [examples](./examples/) for more complex examples.

## Give projectsveltos a try

If you want to try projectsveltos with a test cluster:

1. git clone https://github.com/projectsveltos/addon-controller
2. make quickstart

will create a management cluster using Kind, deploy clusterAPI and projectsveltos, create a workload cluster powered by clusterAPI.
