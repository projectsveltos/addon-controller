                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must refer
                        only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must
                        be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                        3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                        the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it
                        hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                        are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                        and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                        is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                        struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                        this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an
                        underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead of
                        using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                        is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container
                            within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                            (where "name" refers to the name of the container that

                      cluster. Any subsequent feature configuration change won't be

                      will be deployed in such a cluster. Any subsequent feature configuration

                      cluster. A report instead will be generated summarizing what

                      made to ClusterProfile while in DryRun mode.
