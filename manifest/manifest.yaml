                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                        ValuesFrom can reference ConfigMap/Secret instances. Within the ConfigMap or Secret data,
                        it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                        Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                            Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                            These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                            With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                            These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                            to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                            construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                            For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                            '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                            This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                            Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                            The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                            region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                            This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                            the actual region retrieved earlier.

                      Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                      the same cluster resources.
                      Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                      resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                      Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                      Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                      Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                      Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                      when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                            Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                            These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                            With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                            These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                            to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                            construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                            For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                            '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                            This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                            Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                            The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                            region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                            This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                            the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                referencing a part of an object.

                      Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                      the same cluster resources.
                      Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                      resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                      Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                      Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                      Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                      Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                      when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting

                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.
