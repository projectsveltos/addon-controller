## Branches

Projectsveltos repos have two types of branches: the main branch and release-X branches.

The main branch is where development happens. All the latest and greatest code, including breaking changes, happens on main.

The release-X branches contain stable, backwards compatible code. On every major or minor release, a new branch is created. It is from these branches that minor and patch releases are tagged. In some cases, it may be necessary to open PRs for bugfixes directly against stable branches, but this should generally not be the case.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please report them by creating a new issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/projectsveltos/addon-controller/issues) tab.
