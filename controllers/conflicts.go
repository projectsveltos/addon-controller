// Any Helm chart can be managed by only one ClusterProfile/Profile instance
// Any Kubernetes resources can be managed by only one ClusterProfile/Profile instance
// A conflict arises when a ClusterProfile or Profile tries to manage a resource (chart
// or Kubernetes object) already controlled by another. These conflicts are resolved based on tier.
// Each ClusterProfile or Profile belongs to a specific tier, with lower tiers taking precedence.
// In case of a tie (same tier), the existing owner (the Profile/ClusterProfile currently managing
// the resource) retains control.

// Determines if a ClusterProfile/Profile can take ownership of a resource
// currently managed by another ClusterProfile/Profile.
// This function considers the tier of the claiming ClusterProfile/Profile
// (represented by 'claimingTier') and the current owner information
// (`currentOwner`). Ownership can be transferred if the claiming profile
// belongs to a lower tier than the current owner. In case of tiers being
// equal, the function returns false to maintain the current ownership.
//
// Args:
//
//	currentOwnerTier:  The tier of the ClusterProfile/Profile currently with ownership
//	claimingTier: The tier of the ClusterProfile/Profile trying to take ownership
//
// Returns:
//   - true if the claiming ClusterProfile/Profile has higher ownership priority (lower tier),
//   - false otherwise.
